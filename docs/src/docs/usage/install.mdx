## Binary

Most installations are done for CI (e.g. Travis CI, CircleCI). It's important to have reproducible CI:
don't start to fail all builds at the same time. With golangci-lint this can happen if you
use deprecated option `--enable-all` and a new linter is added or even without `--enable-all`: when one upstream linter is upgraded.

It's highly recommended to install a specific version of golangci-lint available on the [releases page](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/releases).

Here is the recommended way to install golangci-lint {.LatestVersion}:

```bash
# binary will be $(go env GOPATH)/bin/golangci-lint
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin {.LatestVersion}

# or install it into ./bin/
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s {.LatestVersion}

# In alpine linux (as it does not come with curl by default)
wget -O- -nv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s {.LatestVersion}

golangci-lint --version
```

It is advised that you periodically update version of golangci-lint as the project is under active development
and is constantly being improved. For any problems with golangci-lint, check out recent [GitHub issues](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/issues) and update if needed.

## macOS

You can also install a binary release on macOS using [brew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install golangci/tap/golangci-lint
brew upgrade golangci/tap/golangci-lint
```

## Docker

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app golangci/golangci-lint:{.LatestVersion} golangci-lint run -v
```

## Go

Go source installations are supported for the two most recent Go releases.

```bash
go get github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@{.LatestVersion}
```
